# WarpShift Challenge

Find all possible optimal solutions for the WarpShift game in the least amount of time.

Idea for 1st attempt:
1. Fast hash function to compare states
2. Heurestic to explore best space first

Implemented:
1. State hash based on strings representation of map
2. Search finding first optimal solution with pure brute force

Chapter progress:
- Chapter 1: Done
- Chapter 2: Colored openings not implemented yet
